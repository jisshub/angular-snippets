create an event emitter to emit the data as object to appcomponent on click event.
in app components view, specif this emitter event and assign a function to it. which
gets the emitted data from the eventEmitter.  
in app component code, define the above function and get the data in a parameter of type object.
later push this each object to an array declared in app component code.
to list each data on another component, use ngFor directive on that components selector.
and also pass each object data to a property using property biniding, 
in components code - define that property using  @Input decorator.
