routes in angular
--------------------

revgister the aroutes
---------------------
app.modules.ts - always register the routes in App Module.

App.Module.ts
----------------
import { Routes } from '@angular/core'


// path in an arary of objects 
const appRoute: Routes = [
  // empty path loads to HomeCompoenent
  {path: '', component: HomeComponent},
  // users path loads to UsersCompoennt
  {path: 'users', component: UsersComponent},
  {path: 'servers', component: ServersComponent}
]

sp when user naviagtes 'users' path, some action need to happen like any compoenent should b loaded. so for that specfy component  to get loaded when navigates to users path.

so now v set all path, but need to do more for working

how angular know these routes.

for that v add 'RouterModule' to the import list in app.module.ts

next have to regisetr it,

RouterMOdule has a method called forRoot() thaT registers our routes with the angular.

> pass the appRoute constant to the forRoot(),

> RouterModule.forRoot(appRoute)

so now angular know this appRoute. but, angular doeant know where rto dispaly comaponent in app.component.html based on naviagtions .

app.compoenent,html
----------------------
we add a angular directive in html, 
	
	<router-outlet></router-outlet>


this directive marks the place in which the compoenent to be shown according to the routes user navigates to.

so that compoenent's view will be shown in the place we specify the router-outlet directive

for eg: if naovgate to 'users', then UsersCompoenent is shown in router-outlet directive's place.


eg:

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-2">
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </div>
  </div> 

based on routes we navigates to, directive get replaced by the various compoenents.
