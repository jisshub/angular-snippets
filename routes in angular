routes in angular
--------------------

revgister the aroutes
---------------------
app.modules.ts - always register the routes in App Module.

App.Module.ts
----------------
import { Routes } from '@angular/core'


// path in an arary of objects 
const appRoute: Routes = [
  // empty path loads to HomeCompoenent
  {path: '', component: HomeComponent},
  // users path loads to UsersCompoennt
  {path: 'users', component: UsersComponent},
  {path: 'servers', component: ServersComponent}
]

sp when user naviagtes 'users' path, some action need to happen like any compoenent should b loaded. so for that specfy component  to get loaded when navigates to users path.

so now v set all path, but need to do more for working

how angular know these routes.

for that v add 'RouterModule' to the import list in app.module.ts

next have to regisetr the routes with angular app,

RouterMOdule has a method called forRoot() thaT registers our routes with the angular.

> pass the appRoute constant to the forRoot(),

> RouterModule.forRoot(appRoute)

so now angular know this appRoute. but, angular doeant know where rto dispaly comaponent in app.component.html based on naviagtions .

app.compoenent,html
----------------------
we add a angular directive in html, 
	
	<router-outlet></router-outlet>


this directive marks the place in which the compoenent to be shown according to the routes user navigates to.

so that compoenent's view will be shown in the place we specify the router-outlet directive

for eg: if naovgate to 'users', then UsersCompoenent is shown in router-outlet directive's place.


eg:

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-offset-2">
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </div>
  </div> 

based on routes we navigates to, directive get replaced by the various compoenents.






Naivhating with router links
----------------------------

now the issues is we hasve to type each path in he addres bar to navigate to routes

so here wwe may add the lnks like below,

aplp.component.html
-----------------
<li role="presentation" class="active"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
<li role="presentation"><a href="/servers">Servers</a></li>
<li role="presentation"><a href="/users">Users</a></li>

so here v provide the path to href attibutes.

but the problem when v navigatet from one to another, page refreshes. and all data in prevous is lost. 

note:

when v click a link that request is sent to the server. and serves gives the response.
so insuch page reloads to give the response.

but it is not the good behavour of out app . since it always reloads our app
while naviagtions.

we can solve it by usng a special directive called 'routerLink'

and pass the route to this link.

<li role="presentation" class="active"><a routerLink='/'>Home</a></li>
<li role="presentation"><a routerLink='/servers'>Servers</a></li>

// can also set routerLink as proerty binding. and pass the route in an array
// if direcvlty given, it notworks since property binding expects a property

// to oercome it we set the path in array.
<li role="presentation"><a [routerLink]=['users/']>Users</a></li>


so tjis routerLink catches the click on links - prevent default behaviour of webpage to reload - and directs the user to link clicked without any page reload.


understanding navigation paths
---------------------------------
servers.component.html 
-------------------

<!-- navigate to users page from current page - set relative path routerLink -->

<a [routerLink]="['/users']" routerLinkActive="router-link-active">Reload to Users</a>



> routerLinkActive directive
---------------------------------
This directive lets you add a CSS class to an element when the link's route becomes active.

<a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link">Bob</a>

When the url is either '/user' or '/user/bob', the active-link class will be added to the a tag. If the url changes, the class will be removed.
