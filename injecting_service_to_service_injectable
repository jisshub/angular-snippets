Appmodule.ts
----------

provide both the AccountService, loggingServices to the
providers property.

providers: [AccountService, LoggingServices],

so now the instanc of theses aviable whole applicarion.

and remove theses services from component 'providers

@injectable()
---------------

always add @injectable() decorator to the services. (good practice)

@injectable is added when v inject a service to another service

Example
-------

consider service1 and service2. 
want to inject service2 -> service1

so here v should add @injectable() to the service1 since 
it is the service where v inject service2.
